# Shoe Sales Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes shoe sales data from August 2024 to February 2025 to uncover sales trends, product performance, and financial insights. The client raised concerns about potential staff fraud—such as selling shoes at inflated prices and misreporting transfers—along with inventory losses. The analysis and dashboard were designed to tackle these issues by tracking surplus payments, receivables, and inventory discrepancies, providing the client with transparency and oversight.

**Important Note on Data**: The current dataset spans only seven months (August 2024 to February 2025), which is less than a full year. This limited timeframe makes it too early to perform year-over-year comparisons. The trends observed here are based on the available records I could clean and work with, but they are likely to change as more sales data is added to the sheet over time. The analysis will grow more reliable with ongoing updates.

## Key Findings
- **Total Sales**: 8,826,040 Naira from 582 units sold.
- **Top Shoe Style**: Rose, generating 2,404,630 Naira in sales.
- **Primary Market**: Lagos, accounting for ~76% of total sales in 2024.
- **Financial Issues**: 
  - Surplus payments on some orders suggest staff overcharging.
  - Deficits in reported transfers hint at under-reporting or fraud.
- **Inventory Problems**: Inconsistencies indicate looted inventory being resold externally.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: Used Pivot Tables, Charts, and Formulas to identify payment and inventory discrepancies.

## How to Use
1. Download `Final_Cleaned_2024_2025_Sales-Ak Portfolio` from this repository.

3. **Monitor Surplus Payments**: Spot orders with excess payments.
4. **Track Receivables**: Check outstanding amounts for financial accuracy.
5. **Analyze Trends**: Apply filters to detect patterns in discrepancies over time.

**Data Update Tip**: The trends will evolve as more sales are recorded. Regularly update the Excel sheet with new data to refine insights and strengthen the analysis.

## Challenges and Learnings
- **Challenge**: Uncovering fraud patterns in messy data (e.g., missing cost prices, inconsistent records).
- **Solution**: Built a dashboard to streamline monitoring of payments and receivables.
- **Learned**: Enhanced skills in data cleaning and providing actionable insights.
